# python-api-challenge



#### Information

This assignemnt was completed over the course of a few days and with the help of a number of AskBCS assistants. Some of the code is direclty lifted from previous class assignments, such as the linear regression calculations. A small portion was given by classmate David Pinskey in the same linear regression function. It is commented above and below indicating where the code came from.

In pulling up this code once it was pushed to the repository I noticed that the map plots with the locations of the cities that were selected for the dataframe was not generated here on github. Please note that this worked well in the ipynb notebook and is likely a quirk of github itself.
